## Extreme Programming

Extreme Programming (XP) started March 6, 1996. Kent Beck was hired by Chrysler to help with the perfomance of the Payment system they were building in Smalltalk. Beck evaluated their software and development processes and found all the real problems where in their development processes rather than code. Chrysler asked him to resolve the issues so he brought in Ward Cunningham and others to envolve new development methods. Those methods they eventually published and described as Extreme Programming.

Extreme Programming is one of many Agile Methodoligies and predates the Agile Manifesto.

Key practices in XP include:
* Pair Programming
* Test Driven Development
* Automated Acceptance Tests
* Planning and working in short iterations
